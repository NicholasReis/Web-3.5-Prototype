# Description
The internet has been widely dominated by monolithic companies and algorithms. There is very little that individuals can do apart from surrendering their access to widely popular websites, services, and platforms. To generalize my approach to this project, I will be modelling a platform based off of a smart-phone privilege structure. The server will act, only as an interpreter, the clients will be able to connect and interact with each other through the platform, while maintaining full control over their data, preferences, and experience.

## Road Map
I will begin by building a java server and client system. A simple socket system should be enough to demonstrate a client-platform enterpreter. From there I will introduce rules for interaction between clients that will be supported by the server. The server will act only as an interpreter and information coordinator, much like a phone operator. I will start to focus on security, likely focussing on pgp based encryption and adding functionality for posting and viewing content.

This will be done in Java because it is the language I am most familiar with and just want to get something off the ground quickly.
